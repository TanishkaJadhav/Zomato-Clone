The Zomato Clone is a full-stack web/mobile application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It replicates the core features of Zomato, allowing users to discover nearby restaurants, browse menus, read/write reviews, and place food delivery orders  all within an intuitive and responsive UI. The application provides distinct interfaces for customers, restaurant partners, and optionally delivery personnel, each tailored to their specific needs. Itâ€™s designed to demonstrate a strong understanding of front-end development using React.js, RESTful API creation with Express and Node.js, and robust data handling with MongoDB.
